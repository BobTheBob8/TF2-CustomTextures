Before we do anything else, you want to create a backup of the file `pc_stream.starpak`. You can locate it in the game directory here: `\Titanfall2\r2\paks\Win64`. It is the biggest file in the folder, about 10GB. Make sure the backups are not in the game directory, maybe put it in on your desktop. This is where the skins are stored.

The final download is a skin from #custom-skins-collection in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/sEgmTKg), I'll use my own that I made a while ago. (Note: you don't need to extract the zip folder that has the skin)

If you don't see the skins in game (_in_ game, not the menu), you may need to turn up your texture filtering to at least 8x
