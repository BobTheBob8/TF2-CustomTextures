## The Context

### **IF YOU DONT READ THIS, I'll kill BT third time.**

You're here because you want to use custom skins and have no idea what you're talking about. We don't want to waste our time and your time with asking awkwardly detailed questions.&#x20;

**Pay attention.** **You're going to have to tell us exactly which method you're attempting** to install after you read this.

### There is 3 types of custom skinning methods.

The hyperlinks link to how to install each type.

*   ****[**DDS (rpak method)**](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1002068248151470120/1019786338804973661/propermodinstallation.gif)****

    **Installed just like Northstar mods.** This is the best overall method.&#x20;
*   ****[**DDS (skintool method)**](https://retryy.gitbook.io/tf2/Guide/Install/dds)****

    **Installed with skintools.** This is bad. Stop using this.&#x20;
*   ****[**VTF (vpk method)**](https://retryy.gitbook.io/tf2/Guide/Install/vtf-manual-modding)****

    **Installed manually.** This is good for modders. Don't touch this (unless you want to).&#x20;

## The Comparison

### DDS (rpak method)

{% hint style="info" %}
The tool used to make these goes by RePak, but you never actually use it.
{% endhint %}

#### Check the mod advertisement.

A good modder will have context on their mod download/advertisement. Check for "installed as a mod", "mod", "thunderstore mod".

#### **Installed like any other Northstar mod.**&#x20;

They should appear like the common Northstar mod.&#x20;

* author.modSkinName
  * paks, mods, or vpk folder inside
  * mod.json

Example:

#### Should appear in 'mods' list inside Northstar.

They should appear like the common Northstar mod.&#x20;

* author.modSkinName

#### If you still need more clarification.

* Reread the wiki page (It took me 1 hour to create and organize this one section).&#x20;
* Then think about for 30 seconds.
* Then ask us clarifying questions.

### DDS (skintool method)

**Installed with a "skintool".**

#### SkinTool

The "skintool"s we are talking about are

* Strykus's Fork skintool: [https://github.com/Strykus/Titanfall2-SkinTool](https://github.com/Strykus/Titanfall2-SkinTool)
* zxcPandoras skintool: [https://github.com/zxcPandora/Titanfall2-SkinTool](https://github.com/zxcPandora/Titanfall2-SkinTool)

Images of skintools UI (there is no visual between the two)

#### Skin

You usually download a zip from #skin-collection in Discord

### VTF (vpk method)

**Installed manually with a hex editor and vpks.**

Send us screenshots. I have no idea how to identify this method simply. You are probably just no idea what's going on and how to actually get skins in the game properly.
