# YOU GOT SENT HERE XD

## The Context

#### **READ THIS OMG**

You're here because you have no idea what you're talking about and we don't want to waste our time with asking awkwardly detailed questions and filling #skins-chat with them.

Now. **Pay attention.** **You're going to have to tell us exactly which method you're attempting** to install after you receive and read this.

#### There is 3 types of custom skinning methods.

The hyperlinks lead to how to install each.

*   ****[**DDS (rpak method)**](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1002068248151470120/1019786338804973661/propermodinstallation.gif)****

    This is the best overall method.&#x20;
*   ****[**DDS (skintool method)**](https://retryy.gitbook.io/tf2/Guide/Install/dds)****

    This is bad. Stop using this.
*   ****[**VTF (vpk method)**](https://retryy.gitbook.io/tf2/Guide/Install/vtf-manual-modding)****

    This is good for modders. Don't touch this (unless you want to).

Next, The Comparison. This is where you start using your amazing chuck of fat in your skull that is capable of comparison and problem solving to find out which skin method you have.

**USE YOUR BRAIN** jeez

## The Comparison

### DDS (rpak method)

### DDS (skintool method)

The "skintool" we are talking about are

* zxcPandoras skintool:&#x20;

### VTF (vpk method)

Send us screenshots. I have no idea how to identify this method simply.
