# Legion Tools

### [Legion](https://wiki.modme.co/wiki/apps/Legion.html) - RPAK Extractor/Model Converter

Created by DXZporter who is now retired. (mostly) Closed source. Original Legion. Recommended Legion for converting models for Blender (and i think exporting audio).

### [Legion+](https://github.com/r-ex/LegionPlus) - RPAK Extractor/Model Converter

Created by many people. Open source. Updated, more feature full and popular. Recommended Legion for most things excluding converting models (and i think exporting audio).
