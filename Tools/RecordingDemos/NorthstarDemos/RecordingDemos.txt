This is a video and archive i made for someone in order to teach them how to record demos in Northstar.
I figured I could put it here because

1. It's cool
2. It needs more love
3. It could help with showcasing your custom skin(s)

Anyways,
here is the provided paragraph.

Tutorial that goes side to side with (Edited)Northstar_CameraTools_v103.rar

Recording Cinematics? In Northstar? 
Yes. Here is how. 4:24 minute video.
Perferred you have a Xbox controller and a numpad.
This video goes over using and installing my Northstar_Cinematics.rar and using all the tools.

Northstar_Cinematics.7z/.rar is a collection of files and tools that are used for cinematics. Including. 
-'build yourself' far viewmodel weapons; 'invisible weapons' from shampooh mod dump
-my personal cinematic autoexec.cfg (thanks to cylas for the 1st version)
-Titanfall2_CameraTools_v103 edited slightly to work with NorthstarLauncher.exe
-lastly an edited (read me for easier installion) NoHudToggle mod.
