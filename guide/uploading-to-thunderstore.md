{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/V1.Skin_template_Thunderstore.zip" %}
THIS ISN"T THE FINAL
{% endfile %}

## 1. Your skin .zip placement

Replace `PLACEHOLDER_SKIN.ZIP.zip` with you own skin.

This is found in `Skin_template_Thunderstore\Skin template Thunderstore\ZIP_ME_TO_UPLOAD\mods\PLACEHOLDER_SKIN_NAME\PLACEHOLDER_SKIN_ZIP.zip`.

## 2. Thunderstore Mod Icon

{% hint style="success" %}
Make sure your`icon.png` is 256x256 pixels in size.
{% endhint %}
