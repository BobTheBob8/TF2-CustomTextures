# VTF (Manual Modding)

## TLDR

There isn't a tool.

There won't be a tool.

If you need vtf skins. Mod them yourselves. Docs found here:

[vtf.md](../Installing/vtf.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

and

## Lore?

Hello curious doc reader. Don't worry, unless you needed this tool to exist. There was at one point a half done tool for automatic vtf skin installation but it was never released. Sucks real bad because a website workshop was also going to be added. Anyways. VTF is too uncommon to upload raw. There are a handful of skins that would benefit from a tool but with converting the skins into northstar mods being easy, most vtf skins are implemented as such. If you really need to get vtf skins. There are a couple of docs on how to mod vtf skins yourself. Find them here: [https://r2northstar--67.org.readthedocs.build/en/67/guides/VTFModding.html](https://r2northstar--67.org.readthedocs.build/en/67/guides/VTFModding.html)&#x20;

and

{% content-ref url="../Installing/vtf.md" %}
[vtf.md](../Installing/vtf.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Goodluck.
