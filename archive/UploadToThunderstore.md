# Uploading to Thunderstore

### We'll use the included template below to help us upload to Thunderstore.

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/Template.zip" %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Unzip the `Template.zip` file.
{% endhint %}

### Here is the "Package Format Documentation" if you'd like: [https://thunderstore.io/package/create/docs/](https://thunderstore.io/package/create/docs/).

## 1. Skin .zip placement

Replace `SKIN.zip` with you own skin.

This is found in `Template\mods\SKIN_NAME\SKIN.zip`

You can also rename the `SKIN_NAME` folder to your preferred skin name.

## 2. Thunderstore Mod Icon

In `Template/mods/icon.png` replace `icon.png` with your own icon named `icon.png`.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
`icon.png` has to be 256x256 pixels in size.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
This is the first thing people see when browsing Thunderstore.
{% endhint %}

If you need help with making this icon:

<summary>Making a 256 x 256  icon with Pixlr X</summary>

### Pixlr X:

Go to [https://pixlr.com/x/](https://pixlr.com/x/)

Also found in&#x20;

[#pixlr.com-free-website](Tools\(old\).md#pixlr.com-free-website "mention")

### Creating the Image

Press `Create new` in the middle of webpage.

![](../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-000013.png)

Make your file a Width of 256 and Height of 256.

Drop and drop your image you chose for an icon.

Select `Add current`.

Zoom out so you can see the resize guides.

Now move and scale the image to your preferred view.

#### "SNAPPING IS IN MY WAY!!!"

1. Click the 'Preferences' "settings" gear symbol in the bottom left.
2. Disable "Snap to guides"

![](../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-000018.png)

#### Feel free to add text, background or whatever you want to your icon.

When you are satisfied\
Click 'Save' on the bottom right.

Make sure you have '256 x 256px' image size and Selected PNG for export.

Click 'Save As'

Rename the image and click 'Apply'

#### There it is. You made a 256x256 icon preview for your skin!

</details>

## 3. Customize your README.md

{% hint style="info" %}
.md file types stand for Markdown. You can still edit these with standard text editors (like Notepad).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

It is recommended you use a previewer; either online or in a text editor. We can use [https://markdownlivepreview.com/](https://markdownlivepreview.com/) for this.&#x20;

You can also use [https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) for syntax for formatting.

Or look at the README.md published on Thunderstore: [here](https://northstar.thunderstore.io/package/when\_you\_when\_i/SKIN\_NAME/0.0.2/).

#### Just customize the README.md to your liking.

Transfer from website. Save. Done

## 4. Configure manifest.json

{% hint style="info" %}
To edit a .json files. Open them in text editors.
{% endhint %}

All you need to replace is `"SKIN_NAME",` and `"Description",`. Version number if you'd like.

Save. Done.

## 5. Finalizing the mod zip.

#### Make sure to zip the files. Not a containing folder!

So it's like this:

![Correct pack.](../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-000027.png)

Not like:

![Incorrect pack.](../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-000028.png)

You should now have your own `SKIN_NAME.zip` mod!

## 6. Uploading to Thunderstore

{% hint style="warning" %}
You CANNOT remove your mods once they are published onto Thunderstore.
{% endhint %}
